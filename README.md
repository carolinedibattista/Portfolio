# Portfolio
Caroline M DiBattista Portfolio

This repository contains the code I wrote to build my portfolio web site: www.codedog.design.  My site uses several js/css plugins.  These are not included in my github site.  Plugins should be downloaded directly from their developers' sites.

The website is built on a foundation framework with several external plugins:
  - typit
  - colorbox
  - magicAnimation
  - waypoints
  - slick slider
  - flip
  - timeline
